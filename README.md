Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software Engineering Process is a process that majorly involves computer science, information technology, and discrete mathematics that is mainly related to computers, programming, and writing codes for building applications while traditional programming is a process that majorly involves science, mathematics, and empirical knowledge that involves building cars, machines, hardware, buildings, etc.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

The 7 Phases of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) include:
Stage 1: Project Planning
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc.
Stage 2: Gathering Requirements & Analysis
This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. 

Stage 3: Design
It involves creating a pre-production version of the product in order to visualize what the product will look like and make changes without having to go through the hassle of rewriting code.
Stage 4: Coding or Implementation
In this stage the development team turns the software requirement into code that makes the product. 
Stage 5: Testing
The testing team tests the functionality of the entire system.
Stage 6: Deployment
Once the testing is done, the product is released for customers to use.
Stage 7: Maintenance
Maintenance is the seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Agile Methodology: Focuses on flexibility and customer satisfaction by continuously delivering functional software components while Waterfall Model is a step-by-step method where each stage must be finalized prior to the commencement of the subsequent one.

Key Differences between Waterfall and Agile:
Flexibility: Agile Model welcomes changes even in late development stages while Waterfall Model changes are difficult and costly once the project is underway

Approach: Agile Model is Iterative and incremental while waterfall model is Sequential and linear

Project Planning: Agile Model requires Minimal upfront planning while waterfall model requires Extensive planning at the beginning of the project

When Should Agile vs. Waterfall Be Used?
Waterfall is particularly useful for large, complex projects with very specific and unchanging requirements while Agile works well for projects that prize learning and are seeking or refining their product-market fit. 



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering (RE) refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. Requirement engineering provides the appropriate mechanism to understand what the customer desires, analyzing the need, and assessing feasibility, negotiating a reasonable solution, specifying the solution clearly, validating the specifications and managing the requirements as they are transformed into a working system.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
It’s a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components.

How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
By dividing software into distinct modules, developers can manage, update, and scale parts of the application independently, leading to more efficient maintenance and easier scalability.



Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
The different Types of Tests
1.	Unit tests: They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
2.	Integration tests: Integration tests verify that different modules or services used         by your application work well together. 
3.	System Testing: is the phase where a tester checks a complete and fully integrated system as a whole. 
4.	Acceptance testing: Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

Why testing is crucial in software development
Before the release, any software product passes 4 main orders of testing that allow the development team to ensure the correct operation of the system.




What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software team’s work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

There are plenty of different version control systems, some of the most popular include: GitHub, Mercurial, Bit bucket etc.

GitHub: It is an open source version control system that features local branching, multiple workflows, and convenient staging areas.

Mercurial: It is a free and distributed control management service that provides a simple and intuitive user interface.

Bit bucket: The main features of Bit bucket are code branches, in-line commenting and discussions, and pull requests.






Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Responsibilities of software project manager
•	Planning the project
•	Creating a schedule and timeline
•	Executing each phase
•	Managing the budget
•	Serving as the liaison among all stakeholders
•	Troubleshooting and maintenance 

What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Some challenges faced in managing software projects include;
•	Time constraints
•	Project scope
•	Budgeting issues
•	Inadequate risk management
•	Lack of communication
•	Lack of accountability
•	Lack of clear goals and success criteria
•	Inadequate skill of team members
•	Limited engagement of stakeholders







Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. 

Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.  

Maintenance activities include:

•	Corrective Software Maintenance: is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors.
•	Preventative Software Maintenance: This includes making   necessary changes, upgrades, adaptations and more. 
•	Perfective Software Maintenance:  aims to adjust software by adding new features as necessary and removing features that are irrelevant or not effective in the given software.
•	Adaptive software maintenance: has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software. 




What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethics in software engineering is about making decisions that respect user privacy, promote fairness, and benefit society. It involves adhering to professional codes, navigating ethical dilemmas, and understanding the impact of unethical practices.

Some ethical issues that software engineers might face include:
•	Negative publicity for your company/employer
•	Loss of work
•	Negative impact on future job prospects
•	Damage to personal reputation


How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
•	Strive to be honest and transparent in all interactions
•	Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
